<p>1. List Description and Purpose</p>

<p>I want a comprehensive categorization of my idea-space. I would like it to generalize to human idea-space, but I doubt that a &lsquo;complete&rsquo; list &ndash; categorizing all relevant books in a field, and having every category of book &ndash; would be practical or efficient.<br />
This list should make my book choices more aware of opportunity costs and allow me to consider a wider set of options. I should also be able to see holes in my knowledge space.<br />
 <br />
2. Priority and Choice</p>

<p>Whenever possible, I&rsquo;ll read books that will be readily applicable to the next month of my life. I&rsquo;ll pay attention to them while reading because I&rsquo;m anticipating their application, and then in applying them I will encode more of the material into memory by actively applying it.</p>
