		<p>I'm a Junior at Harvard College, concentrating in <em>Applied Mathematics and Economics</em> with a strong focus on Behavioral Economics.
		A partner and I built an Iphone app called Timestamp last summer, a quantified self app dedicated to time tracking.
		I've been really interested in productivity and decision making my whole life.</p>

		<p>I'm extremely motivated to be able to create. The inability to create effective websites and web applications
		 gave me difficulty in promoting a product and interacting with potential users. I want to have those skills on hand.
		 I also want to turn creative ideas for websites into a real online presence.

	<div class="text" id="webexp">
		<p>I've spent a lot of time with online tutorials and textbooks on HTML and CSS, and I used Ruby on Rails to create a rudimentary
		 interactive website last summer. I'm very familiar with version control using git.</p>

		<p>I followed the first 4 chapters of a text in PHP in preperation for this course, covering: <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Variables and Operators
				<li>Conditional Statements
				<li>Loops
				<li>Arrays			
			</ul>
		Which is the extent of my PHP experience.

		<p>I'm working on a personal Dell Latitude laptop. I'm accustomed to coding in Ubuntu, so using WAMP will be an interesting (and so far convenient!) change.</p>
